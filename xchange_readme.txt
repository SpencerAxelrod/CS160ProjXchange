XCHANGE README

The following steps require the Kinoma Studio IDE. This project can be run on Android, iOS, and Kinoma Create (e.g, export the project to APK from Kinoma studio).

IMPORTING THE PROJECTS
In order to build and run our application, please follow these steps.

1. Ensure that there are no projects in your Kinoma workspace entitled "CoinInteractive" or "deviceSimulator."  If they exist, delete them completely, including from your disk (Kinoma will ask you this when you delete a project).

2.  Unzip the file for XchangeApp.

3.  Go to File -> Import, then select General -> Existing Project into Workspace.  

4.  Check "Select root directory," then browse to find the location of the unzipped file named "CoinInteractive."

5.  Make sure the project is checked and click finish.

6.  Repeat steps 2-5 for "xchange_simulator."


RUNNING THE APPLICATION

Because our project requires parsing JSON from the device to the application, please open both projects and allow for 5 to 10 seconds before clicking "Get Started."  This will ensure that there are no errors upon launch.  Thanks for reading, enjoy your new app!!!!!
